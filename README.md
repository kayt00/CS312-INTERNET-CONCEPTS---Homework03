# CS312-INTERNET-CONCEPTS---Homework03

In this assignment I developed a website that allows a user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against my algorithm. All rules of the game apply except the only catch is that the user can't have more than four tokens on the board at any given time. Everytime a fifth token is played, the first token in the queue is removed.
